Ayush kumar(ft33_117) tips from the topper ->

- try to make notes and code with sir while they'r teaching

- u'll get chance to appear in the interviews within this unit only and when u'r in placement things don't leave the lectures topics

- there will be no coding standup in this unit

- important topics are covered in the last sprints 




Prab sir ->
if u'll miss one day without practicing ur whole previous work will get wasted, so don't miss a single day, 
coding is not like gym that u've to relax the muscles, u have to practice daily just for one month and for rest 1 decade it'll be easy 

js is very small, its not as big as java or rust, so there are definite quesions that can be asked in the interviews 

Rules for classes ->

1. Have communication           -> ask any quesitons in the class if u r not understanding any topics
2. Notes                        -> take/note down important topics that i ask u, take note of imp interview questions
3. Assingnments                 -> read all the assignment, u can't complete all the assingment, so do the imp quesions of the assign, not all
4. coding in the class          -> don't stop when try to code with sir, u'll left on many topics when trying to code with sirbut then don't stop don't give up, it happens, don't fall for seeing recorded video learing

Mongo - database
Express - Server
Node - runtime/backend
React - frontend

it'll happen that u'll forget the mongo after learing express, it happens, but u have to keep practicing by that only u'll remeber all the things


Lecture -> 

what is node js?
Brendan Eich - creater of js in 10 days in 1995 during the war btw netscape and internet Explorer
js was created so that developer can maniupte elements in the web i.e DOM manipulation 

Ryan Dahl - in 2009 he thought that why we can't use js to see my computer files and folder 

node can only understand js no css, html, server functions like document.create or window function
