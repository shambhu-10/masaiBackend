In web development, a route refers to the specific URL path or endpoint on a web server that is linked to specific functionality.

In the context of frameworks like Express.js, a route defines the combination of:

1. HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. URL path (e.g., /, /api/movies, /users/:id).
3. Callback function that handles the request and response for that route.




HTTP Request structure:

Header: meta data of the http request
